            <h3>Ux Design Humanities Project 2019</h3>

            <body>In this project, my group and I were given the task of restructuring the information input and output
                system of the Wilfrid Laurier Humanities Course, as well as modifying the website layout and modernizing
                it.</body>

            <h4>Makers Lab Project 2020</h4>

            <body>In this project, my group and I were given the task of "Hacking the conventional box" and creating
                something useful for people. We created a Compact Desk Box that stores small tedious items around the
                person's workspace. We also did this with the use of common and easily attainable materials.</body>

            <br />
            <h5>Makers Lab Project 2020</h5>

            <body>In this project, my group and I were tasked with creating something that revolved around social issues
                relating to Covid-19 and the pandemic. We decided to create a DIY Projector that projects the screen of
                a smartphone or Nintendo Switch. We thought this was a good idea because, with unexpected lock-downs,
                people have to stay home and manage time. This gives them a fun and interesting twist. This item also
                consists of common, reusable, and easily attainable materials.</body>

            <h6>Interaction Design Project 2020</h6>

            <body>In this project, my group and I decided that we would modify the Tinder application for the reason of
                making the application desirable to use to meet and contact new people. We added features such as a
                behavior bar with different colours to indicate levels of behavior. We also added a new filter system
                to help the user filter out individuals they don't wish to interact with.</body>
            <br />
            <br />
            <h7>Makers Lab Project 2021</h7>

            <body>In this project, my group and I created a tool that would allow individuals with physical disabilities
                to interact with technological devices much more comfortably and efficiently. We created a device called
                the "Pair N Play" Pad. This pad would essentially serve as a control centre for these individuals to
                control their devices. We also integrated specifications that would enable users to connect to (IoT) to
                enhance smart home experience and usage.</body>
